# enumerator

This is the repository for Zach's enumerator of grid graph partitions.
For details about the algorithm and an implementation, see the Jupyter notebook.

This is Julia code.  If you already have Julia and Jupyter installed, you can
set up IJulia by calling `Pkg.add("IJulia")` in the Julia REPL.  If you don't
have either of these set up, you can get Julia from the creators at julialang.org
and Jupyter from jupyter.org.

Coming soon: a command line version of this tool
